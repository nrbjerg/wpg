# Usage
Clone the repository

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/nrbjerg/wpg
```
Edit the `config.py` file to your liking, and run 

``` sh
python random_walk.py
```
This will begin the process of coloring the canvas using a random walk, with the colores specified in the config, afterwards the remaining black pixels are removed, this mean that the color "#000000", cannot be used in the final product. This shouldn't take too long, afterwards a custom algorithm is ran to remove unessary noise, this algorithm is **VERY** slow, so be carefull when picking canvas sizes. Please note that the canvas can be scalled up, this however comes with the tradeoff that the final product will be more pixilated (Personally I like this, as a fan of pixel art :D ), however feel free to contribute a better algorithm for removing the noise ;).
